This project uses Pinia, TailwindCSS, Vite, Vue Composition API, and Nodemon.

I created this project to demonstrate my capability in working with APIs, building reactive web apps, and working with various data sources.

After running npm install:
To run this project, use the script "start". Then use the script "dev"

This app is for demonstration purposes only. There is template data as default to show app functionality.
The user can immediately see workout logs and rendered graphs.
The overall concept of this web-app is this: Users can chose a muscle to work on and be directed to relevant exercises. The user can then log a workout to track progress.

Initially, the user is brought to a page that does not exist. This is to immediately show the implementation of the router safety-net in place.

Lessons learned/Understanding Achieved:

- Prop drilling and data passing through provide-inject and Pinia/Stores
- Data fetching and API integration
- Component reusability in Vue
- Vue Composition API

Functionality to add/areas to improve:

- Having data rendered to a graph, rather than the image of a graph.
- Cardio workout data saveable and graphable.
- User input validation/Error Handling.
- SEO
